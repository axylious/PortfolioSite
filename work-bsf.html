               <h2>Problems Encountered+My Solution:</h2>
               <h3>Client Cooperation</h3>
               <p>Although I was working for family, I was still doing business.  Unfortunately, due to the familial bond, our relationship as client and developer was very relaxed.  I planned to rely on them for flooring information and pictures for the site but things did not work out that smoothly.</p>
               <p>Solving this problem was more of a waiting game, the site was not launched until I was able to replace the stock photos I had been using with pictures of their work.  As for the different types of flooring, I asked what was sold then looked them up myself.  After righting a rough draft, they would look it over and either give it a thumbs up or let me know what else might be helpful to add.</p>

               <h3>Site Setup</h3>
               <p>Although I have worked on sites before, I myself had never registered a domain or gone through the process of setting up a website from scratch before.  In the early stage of the registration and hosting, things were going off without a hitch.  At some point in the process I was no longer able to view the site.</p>
               <p>After much fruitless googling, I asked an old boss if he had any ideas as to what the problem might be.  He, himself, had recently encountered that same problem with his web hoster after a recent upgrade to the system.  After a recent update, he, and later, I, had been accidentally IP blacklisted by the system.  The problem was solved within a few messages to support, and I have yet to encounter a problem like that again.</p>

               <h3>Large Expectations</h3>
               <p>Originally, the plans for the site had also included an online showroom so customers would be able to pick a flooring option from the comfort of their home.  Unfortunately, due to the massive amount of variety in types of floors and the colors they come in, it was too much work for me to implement in a timely manner.</p>
               <p>Instead, I offered to create a form customers can use to submit questions.  I used PHP to handle the form submission and send it to the company email.  I plan to incorporate attachments as an option for anyone looking to color match or include more information. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="work-different">
               <h2>What I Would Do Differently</h2>
               <p>I would not have spent time trying to find a picture for all flooring options we offered.  The better part of one week was spent downloading pictures from the supplier's sites.  I would maybe have been a little more assertive when asking for content, but it could have backfired if I came on too strong.  Working with clients is not always a simple process but working with family is a whole other story.</p>
