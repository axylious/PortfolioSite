               <h2>Challenges+My Solution:</h2>
               <h3>Scope Creep</h3>
               <p>Much of my time on this was spent researching Spotify's API Documentation.  As cool and as interesting as it was, the deeper a component was nested the longer, the harder it was for me to pass the data that I wanted through.  My lack of knowledge on React and some inefficiencies in my logic contributed to code that was messier than I wanted.</p>
               <p>To solve this I took a step back and physically wrote down what I wanted to accomplish and in what order.  I started with the front-end as that is where my current strength lies, but I hope to make this a full stack project when my skills allow it.</p>

               <h3>Burnout</h3>
               <p>This came as a result of my scope creep problem.  I was so invested in solving the hardest problems first, I would hardly stop to breathe.  No breaks and not enough progress wore me down to the point where I didn't touch any code for multiple days.</p>
               <p>It hadn't occured to me that by taking time off work to relax, I could finish a lot faster.  I implemented the Pomodoro technique and after a week of forcing myself to take the mini breaks every half hour, I really saw improvement.  After spending so much time in the code, it's easy to forget the big picture.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="work-different">
               <h2>What I Would Do Differently</h2>
               <p>I would have waited until I finished the skeleton to start interacting with the API so I wouldn't have to be creating the front-end while figuring out how to integrate Spotify at the same time.  Taking the time to take breaks is probably the most important lesson I learned during this project.</p>
